🚀 Technology enthusiast and front-end development student ready to make an impact!

🎓 My name is Breno Hideki Umehara, and I'm currently pursuing a degree in Information Systems at Anhembi Morumbi University. I'm deeply focused on honing my skills in front-end development. My passion for technology has led me to delve into languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js, where I strive to specialize, as evidenced by my certifications in Responsive Web Design.

💼 With a solid professional background in finance, I've gained valuable skills that complement my tech education. Over a year at Mirai Imóveis, I served as a Finance Assistant, managing cash flow, issuing invoices, handling accounts payable and receivable, and preparing management reports. Additionally, I've honed my proficiency in tools like Excel, Power BI, and Google Sheets for data analysis and process optimization.

🌐 Fluent in English, Spanish, and with a basic understanding of Japanese, I'm always eager to expand my horizons and take on new challenges. I'm excited to explore opportunities that allow me to apply my passion for technology and make meaningful contributions to innovative projects.
